# network express range

- /8 = 255.0.0.0

- /16 = 255.255.0.0

- /24 = 255.255.255.0

- /32 = 255.255.255.255

- 192.168.1.0/24 = 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255

- 192.168.1.5/24 is still in the same network as above we would have to go to 192.168.2.0 to be on a different network.

- 192.168.1.1/16 = 192.168.1.0-192.168.255.255
